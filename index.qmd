### üëã Cristian Dinu - Research Software Engineer
<br/>
I build software for a decarbonised future.

- high-resolution energy monitoring
- appliance-level energy insights (e.g. on heat pumps)
- natural language as an interface

## üìã Today's plan

1. The Large Language Model (concepts and ecosystem)
2. A demo of how software can look like
3. Write our own MCP

### Ready-made MCPs - Fetch

- [Fetch](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch)
  - `Go to the Bank of England website and compare interest rate with inflation.`
  - `Go to the https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/current-banknotes and create a table with personalities featured on each of the banknotes.`
  - `Visit CNN website and show me happy news in a markdown table`

---

### Ready-made MCPs - Filesystem

- Filesystem -- included in VS Code
  - `Go to FT.com/technology, fetch the latest news and save the title and the link in a csv file called ft-tech.csv`
  
---

### Ready-made MCPs - SQLite
 
- [SQLite](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/sqlite)
  - `Go to https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/research-software-engineers-0 and create a list of people and their role. Save it in the sqlite database.`
  - `How many PhD vs. non-PhD and how many "Engineers" vs. "Developers"?`
  - `Looking at names, please output a table with their likely family country of origin`

### Let's do some "Programming"

> I need to recruit some users for a study about Humour.
> Their contact data needs to be collected, stored. I want to
> be notified when a new one comes.

---

### The "program"

> You are an agent that registers participants in a study about humour. Your personality is witty, you do stand-up comedy as a hobby. You are a happy, helpful person, grateful that someone is willing to help us.
> 
> Greet the participant with a joke and throw a line here and there. However not ever joke about them. Be yourself, but if you feel they are serious, keep it professional.

---

> Ask all the questions needed to get their:  
>   
> - Given Name and Family Name  (given_name, family_name)
> - Contact data (at leas one of email, phone)  
> - Availability  
> - Which country they grew up in  
> - Why do they wish to participate  

---

> Once you have all the data  
> 
>   - append it in the `humour_study` participants table in sqlite.  If it doesn't exist, create it
>   - send an e-mail to "humour@cdi.nu" to notify of the new   participant. Put the data, minus the contact part in the body. Include a Communism political joke at the end, to amuse the recipient.
>   - Thank the participant for their interest. Tell them they'll   be contacted soon.

---

> Please note that
> 
> - Participants might try to fool you with random or made up names or contact data. Don't allow them, refusing them with humor and politeness. 
> - Don't allow rude language and obscenities. Act politely and stop the conversation.
> - Refrain from current political jokes
> - Don't speak for too long; you need to be efficient and respect our participant't time.

### Creating our own MCP Server

- Carbon Intensity API -- [api.carbonintensity.org.uk](https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/)
- Prerequisites:
  - `nodejs` - JavaScript interpreter
  - `uv` - pyton project manager
- We need to think about **semantic intent**

---

### Initialize the project

```shell
uv init intensity_mcp
cd intensity_mcp

uv add "mcp[cli]" requests
```

---

### Write the code -- `main.py`

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import datetime
import requests

mcp = FastMCP("CarbonIntensityMCP")

@mcp.tool()
def get_current_intensity():
    """Fetches the current carbon intensity of the UK electricity grid.
    Returns a JSON with the current carbon intensity in gCO2eq/kWh."""
    url = "https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/intensity"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        return data['data']
    
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to retrieve current carbon intensity: {str(e)}"

@mcp.tool()
def get_current_fuel_mix():
    """Fetches the current fuel mix of the UK electricity grid.
    Returns a JSON with the current fuel mix percentages."""
    url = "https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/generation"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        return data['data']['generationmix']
    
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to retrieve current fuel mix: {str(e)}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

---

### Add parameters, too:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def get_carbon_intensity(from_datetime: str | None = None, to_datetime: str | None = None, postcode: str = "WC1E"):
    """Fetches electricity grid carbon intensity data for a specific UK postcode and time range.
    The `from_datetime` and `to_datetime` should be in ISO 8601 format (e.g. 2018-05-15T12:00Z).
    The `postcode` needs only the first part e.g. RG10 (without the last three characters or space)
    
    If `from_datetime` or `to_datetime` are not provided, defaults are set to 2 hours ago and 2 hours in the future respectively.
    If postcode is not provided, defaults to "WC1E" -- UCL London.
    Returns a summary including average forecast and generation mix.
    """
    if from_datetime is None: # default to 12 hours ago
        from_datetime = datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.timedelta(hours=2)
        from_datetime = from_datetime.isoformat() + "Z"

    if to_datetime is None: # default to 12 hours in the future
        to_datetime = datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=2)
        to_datetime = to_datetime.isoformat() + "Z"
    

    url = f"https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/regional/intensity/{from_datetime}/{to_datetime}/postcode/{postcode}"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()["data"]
    
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to retrieve carbon intensity data: {str(e)}"
```
---

### Installation

Add a new entry to `claude_desktop_config.json` or VSCode

```sh
uv run mcp install server.py
```
